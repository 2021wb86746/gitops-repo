resources:
  - ../../base
 
# You can override values here for the dev environment
nameSuffix: -dev
 
images:
  - name: myregistry/myapp
    newTag: dev-latest
```
 
* `resources: - ../../base` → references the base resources.
* `nameSuffix` → appends `-dev` to Deployment/Service names to distinguish environments.
* `images` → override image tag for this environment.
